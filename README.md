# GDS-MART_SP- Supply Chain Data Analysis

# Project:
    Generate Insights to Solve a Supply Chain Issue in FMCG Domain

# Problem Statement:
GDS Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

GDS Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers have not extended the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.


# Here are my insights I found from the dashboard:
- From the first page, we can trach Top level KPI's such as OTIF%, IF%, OT% and also LIFR%, VOFR%, Total Order Qty, Total Delivered Qty and undelivered Qty.
- We can observe that OTIF% is fat behind than Target.
- VOFR% is similar for almost 6 different products.
- ADD the slicer of prduct category to get the insight .
- we got the citywise shipped quantity.

  # Business-related terms:
- Order lines
- Line Fill Rate
- Volume Fill Rate
- Time delivery %
- Full delivery%
- On Time In Full (OTIF) %
